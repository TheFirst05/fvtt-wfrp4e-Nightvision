This module partially automates the Night Vision talent in the WFRP4e system. The effective dim illumination radius of all light sources is extended for a selected token with the Night Vision talent or trait.

The module assumes your grid units are in yards.
For the cases where Night Vision applies for faint sources of light, I suggest giving the token 20ft basic vision.
