This module partially automates the Night Vision talent in the WFRP4e system. The dimm illumination of all light sources is increased for controlled tokens with the Night Vision talent/trait.

The module assumes your grid units are in yards.
For the cases where Night Vision applies for faint sources of light, I suggest giving the token 20ft basic vision.
